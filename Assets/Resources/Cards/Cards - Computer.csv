CC04		1942	The Atanasoff-Berry Computer	John Vincent Atanasoff	The ABC was at the center of a patent dispute related to the invention of the computer, which was resolved when it was shown that ENIAC co-designer John Mauchly had seen the ABC shortly after it became functional.	https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/1942/
CC05		1943	Relay Interpolator	George Stibitz	M-9 gun director, a type of analog computer that aims large guns to their targets.The Relay Interpolator used 440 relays, and since it was programmable by paper tape, was used for other applications following the war.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_computers_1943.stibitz.jpg
CC06		1944	Harvard Mark 1	Howard Aiken	The Harvard Mark 1 is a room-sized, relay-based calculator. The machine had a fifty-foot long camshaft running the length of machine that synchronized the machine’s thousands of component parts and used 3,500 relays. The Mark 1 produced mathematical tables but was soon superseded by electronic stored-program computers.	https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/1944/
CC07		1946	ENIAC	John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert	ENIAC used panel-to-panel wiring and switches for programming, occupied more than 1,000 square feet, used about 18,000 vacuum tubes and weighed 30 tons. It was believed that ENIAC had done more calculation over the ten years it was in operation than all of humanity had until that time.	https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/3660521353
CC08		1948	The Manchester "Baby"	Frederic Williams, Tom Kilburn, and Geoff Toothill	The Manchester "Baby." The Baby was built to test a new memory technology developed by Williams and Kilburn -- soon known as the Williams Tube – which was the first high-speed electronic random access memory for computers. Their first program, consisting of seventeen instructions and written by Kilburn, ran on June 21st, 1948. This was the first program in history to run on a digital, electronic, stored-program computer.	https://www.flickr.com/photos/paulspace/8239169954

The original design included two memory boards and could generate and store 512 characters as 16 lines of 32 characters. A cassette tape interface provided supplementary storage for text. The TV Typewriter was used by many small television stations well in the 1990s.	https://www.flickr.com/photos/mwichary/2289509670
CC26		1974	The Alto	Xerox Alto	The Alto is a groundbreaking computer with wide influence on the computer industry. It was based on a graphical user interface using windows, icons, and a mouse, and worked together with other Altos over a local area network. It could also share files and print out documents on an advanced Xerox laser printer. Applications were also highly innovative: a WYSISYG word processor known as “Bravo,” a paint program, a graphics editor, and email for example. Apple’s inspiration for the Lisa and Macintosh computers came from the Xerox Alto.	https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Xerox_Alto_computer.jpg
