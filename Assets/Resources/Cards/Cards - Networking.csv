NC01		1933	Telex Messaging Network		Telex starts as a way to distribute military messages, but soon becomes a world-wide network of both official and commercial text messaging that will persist in some countries into the 2000s. Telex uses teleprinters, which date back to the 1910s for use in telegraphy. But instead of using pricey dedicated telegraph lines, the telex system connects those teleprinters to each other over voice telephone lines, routed by modified telephone switches. Wireless versions of Telex soon connect remote regions of the developing world.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1933_telex.jpg
NC02		1934	“World Brain”	Belgian Paul Otlet	Otlet had co-created a massive “search engine” starting in the early 1900s. His Mundaneum now combines enhanced card catalogs with sixteen million entries, photos, documents, microfilm, and more. He is working on integrating telegraphy and multiple media, from sound recordings to television. In the 1930s British writer H.G. Wells and American scientist Vannevar Bush are advancing similar goals—Wells with his “World Brain” writings and Bush with the Memex, a sort of microfilm-based Web browser. These approaches to organizing information differ. But all share key features of today’s Web, including automated cross-references – which we call hyperlinks.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1934_worldbrain.jpg
NC03		1945	“Memex”	Vannevar Bush	The imaginary Memex desk is meant to let a user compare and create links between microfilm documents, somewhat like today’s clickable Web links and bookmarks. The idea is that people will continually build on each other's associative trails through the world's knowledge, helping tackle the growing problem of information overload	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1945_memex.jpg
NC04		1949	MODEM	Jack Harrington	Developed for transmitting radar signals by Jack Harrington’s group at the Air Force Cambridge Research Center (AFCRC) near Boston, the modem modulates digital data into sounds, and demodulates received sounds into digital data. (MODulation + DEModulation = MODEM). Modems will be adapted to computers for the upcoming SAGE system, and commercialized by Bell Telephone . By letting computers use normal voice telephone lines, they offer greater coverage and lower costs than dedicated telegraph or leased data lines.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1949_modem.jpg
NC05		1958	Digital Phone Lines		Phone companies develop digital transmission for internal uses – specifically to put more calls on each of the main lines connecting their own switching centers. By 1958, this produces the T1 standard still used in North America. By the 1980s, phone companies will be leasing digital lines to commercial customers.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1958_digitalphone.jpg
NC06		1961	Timesharing – the first online communities		Many people can share a single computer, using terminals (often repurposed teleprinters) to log in over phone lines. These timesharing computers are like central hubs with spokes radiating to individual users. Although the computers generally can't connect to each other, these are the first common multi-user systems, with dozens of people online at the same time.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1961_timesharing.jpg
NC07		1964	SABRE		Online transaction processing makes its debut in IBM´s SABRE reservation system, set up for American Airlines. Using telephone lines, SABRE links 2,000 terminals in 65 cities to a pair of IBM 7090 computers, delivering data on any flight in less than three seconds. It remains the basis of modern travel sites including Travelocity. SABRE has been adapted from IBM's earlier work on SAGE.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1964_sabre.jpg
NC08		1966	Carterfone		The Carterfone acoustically connects mobile radios to the telephone network. Telephone companies sue in 1966. The FCC supports Carter, freeing U.S. telephone lines for many uses—including later answering machines, faxes and modems. Users in some countries will wait until the 1990s for similar freedoms. Modems create a kind of de facto net neutrality; telephone companies have no control over what is sent over their lines with a modem.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1966_carterphone.jpg
NC09		1968	Multiplexers		Since telegraph days, people have been refining techniques for squeezing more connections onto a single wire. Early multiplexers for computers let up to 15 terminals share the same line, by assigning each of them a particular frequency (Frequency Division Multiplexing).	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1968_multiplexer.jpg
NC10		1969	Interface Message Processor	ARPANET	The ARPAnet is the first large-scale, general-purpose computer network to connect different kinds of computers together. But others come online within weeks or months.The wireless and more specialized ALOHANET in Hawaii (also ARPA funded), and the HLN (High Level Network) for the SITA consortium of commercial airlines. Work begins on France’s CYCLADES network not long after. The ARPAnet’s massive funding will help it pull ahead of rivals.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1969_imp.jpg
NC11		1970	The ERMA system		The ERMA system had revolutionized behind-the-scenes check processing in the 1950s, spawning the funny letters still at the bottom of checks today. During the 1960s researchers in various countries have been working on bringing automation – and online transactions – to customers in the form of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM).	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1970_atm.jpg
NC12		1971	Networked Email as an Early “Killer App”	Ray Tomlinson of Bolt, Beranek and Newman	Messages are free to travel anywhere the network goes, and email explodes. Ray Tomlinson of Bolt, Beranek and Newman chooses the now-iconic “@” sign for his networked email protocol on the ARPANET, well over 50% of traffic on that research-oriented network is email. Nearly all other networks add email features	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1971.tomlinson.jpg
NC13		1973	Packet Radio Research Van	ARPANET	ARPA funds the outfitting of a packet radio research van at SRI to develop standards for a Packet Radio Network (PRNET). As the unmarked van drives through the San Francisco Bay Area, stuffed full of hackers and sometimes uniformed generals, it is pioneering wireless, packet-switched digital networks, including the kind your mobile phone uses today. A related set of experiments test out Voice Over IP (like the later Skype). The van will also play a huge role  as a major birthplace of the Internet.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1973_sri.van.jpg
NC14		1974	SNA (Systems Network Architecture)	IBM	IBM has been building hierarchical, special-purpose networks since the SAGE system and SABRE not long after.It announces Systems Network Architecture (SNA), a set of protocols designed for less centralized networks. SNA will evolve into an internet-like network of networks, albeit one reserved for those that were SNA compliant. DEC and Xerox will also begin commercializing their own proprietary networks, DECNET and XNS. At it’s peak around 1990, IBM’s SNA will quietly carry most of the world's networking traffic.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1974_sna.jpg
NC15		1975	Community Memory		Anyone can walk up and use this terminal, connected to a timeshared mainframe computer, for posting messages and announcements.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1975_communitymemory.jpg

NC21		1990	WorldWideWeb is born	Tim Berners-Lee	It features a server, HTML, URLs, and the first browser. That browser also functions as an editor—like a word processor connected to the Internet – which reflects his original vision that the Web also incorporate authoring and personal organization tools.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking_1990.mosaic-www-browser-editor.jpg
NC22		1993	Mosaic	Marc Andreessen & Eric Brina	The first browser supported by a major institution, starts the Web on the road from research project to blockbuster success.	https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking_1993.mosaic.jpg
